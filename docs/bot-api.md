# The bot API

This is the complete interface a `.onnx` file must satisfy to plug in as an
opponent. It is the only thing `src/hexset/clients/onnxbot.py` reads — the file
does not need access to this repo's source, only to what is written here plus
the public [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) format itself. `hexset.heximax` (the
default handcrafted opponent) and `hexset.bots`' `search2` implement the same
interface a different way and are the reference for what "correct" means when
in doubt.

Two independent parts make up the contract:

1. **Self-description** — `metadata_props` on the ONNX model, read once at
   load time.
2. **The graph itself** — named inputs in, named outputs out. Which shape
   this takes depends on the `contract` key below.

## 1. Self-description (`metadata_props`)

| key | meaning | default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `players` | table size the graph was traced for | required |
| `num_hexes` / `num_vertices` / `num_edges` | board-shape fingerprint; a mismatched board fails the load rather than running on meaningless input | required |
| `contract` | which graph shape below applies: `5`, the record shape | refused if absent — see below |
| `max_trades` | `0` to switch trading off for this checkpoint | trading on |
| `search` | `mcts` to search over the model's own priors; anything else plays one forward pass | none |
| `simulations` | descents per decision, when `search=mcts` (clamped to 4096) | 128 |
| `wave` | leaves batched per expansion, when `search=mcts` (clamped to 256) | 16 |
| `iteration` | informational only; not read for behaviour | 0 |

Unreadable or missing optional keys fall back to their default rather than
failing the load — a typo'd hint costs the hint, not the whole opponent. See
`src/hexset/server/modelmeta.py` for the exact clamping.

Inference device (`cpu`/GPU) is deliberately **not** a metadata key — it is a
fact about the machine serving the game, not the checkpoint.

**The `contract` number is assigned by the exporter, not by this repo.**
`hexset.export_onnx._CONTRACT_VERSION` is the one definition; `hexset.server`
reads it and never writes it. A graph declares the fields it wants and is fed
exactly those, so a graph that predates a field this record has gained still
loads and plays. An unknown number is refused at load with the number named,
rather than failing later on its first move with a missing-input error.

**Only contract 5 is served.** 2, 3 and 4 are the offer protocol's
contracts — 3 added four live-offer fields, 4 the two public-knowledge ledger
fields, and all three declare a `pair_mask` input and a `pair_index` output
for the one-for-one give/want heads. Trading is now one engine event with no
actions at all (see §4), so those graphs describe a game this engine does not
play: there is no honest way to feed them, and they are refused by name.
Contract 1 — the original shape, where the engine encoded the position into
feature tensors and the graph was a bare policy/value head masked in Python —
went the same way on 2026-09-02
(`docs/engine-divergence-2026-09-02.md`, B5).

## 2. The graph — the record contract (`5`)

The engine builds a **record**: the position stated in the rules' own terms,
already filtered to what the perspective seat may legally know. The graph
owns everything downstream of that — encoding, masking, normalising,
argmax, un-rotating back to board-seat order. Built by
`hexset.onnx_record.record_from_game`; the full field-by-field derivation
lives in [`onnx-contract-v2.md`](onnx-contract-v2.md).

Leading batch axis `B` on every tensor.

**Inputs:**

| Name | Shape | dtype |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `terrain` | `(B, num_hexes)` | int64 |
| `token` | `(B, num_hexes)` | int64 |
| `port_code` | `(B, num_vertices)` | int64 |
| `robber` | `(B,)` | int64 |
| `vertex_owner` | `(B, num_vertices)` | int64 |
| `vertex_building` | `(B, num_vertices)` | int64 |
| `edge_owner` | `(B, num_edges)` | int64 |
| `bank` | `(B, NUM_RESOURCES)` | int64 |
| `knights_played` | `(B, players)` | int64 |
| `award_points` | `(B, players)` | int64 |
| `longest_road_holder` | `(B,)` | int64 |
| `largest_army_holder` | `(B,)` | int64 |
| `phase` | `(B,)` | int64 |
| `free_roads` | `(B,)` | int64 |
| `deck_size` | `(B,)` | int64 |
| `turns` | `(B,)` | int64 |
| `perspective` | `(B,)` | int64 |
| `own_hand` | `(B, NUM_RESOURCES)` | int64 |
| `hand_totals` | `(B, players)` | int64 |
| `own_dev` | `(B, NUM_DEV_CARDS)` | int64 |
| `dev_totals` | `(B, players)` | int64 |
| `valuations` | `(B, players, NUM_RESOURCES)` | float32 |
| `ledger_known` | `(B, players, NUM_RESOURCES)` | int64 |
| `ledger_unknown` | `(B, players)` | int64 |
| `action_mask` | `(B, space.size)` | bool |

**Outputs:**

| Name | Shape | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `action_index` | `(B,)` int64 | argmax over the masked distribution |
| `prior` | `(B, space.size)` | normalised over legal actions, zero elsewhere |
| `value` | `(B, players)` | board-seat order, already un-rotated |

`NetworkBot` reads `action_index`; searches read `prior`/`value`. One graph
serves both.

**The engine drift this section used to list is gone.** This server no longer
carries its own copy of the engine: it depends on the `hexset` package (now
one distribution together with the gym, see the CHANGELOG's "one
distribution" entry), so what it plays is exactly what dev-HexNet plays. See
[`engine-divergence-2026-09-02.md`](engine-divergence-2026-09-02.md) for the
full account of what the copy held and how each difference was resolved.

**The one mask difference that used to remain is gone too.** The
`action_mask` served here was built over an *honest* trade sample, because
the engine's own `legal_actions` filtered the offer sample by opponents'
true hands and telling a human that would give away a specific opponent's
hand. There is no offer sample: trading is not an action, no remaining
action's legality depends on another seat's hand, and there is now one list,
`hexset.actions.legal_actions`, for every seat.

## 3. Trading

A checkpoint does not act to trade. Every seat holds a **public valuation
vector** — `valuations` above, five floats in `[-1, 1]` per seat in
board-seat order, positive for "I want more of this" — and once a turn, after
the roll and the robber and before any build is served, the engine clears
exchanges between the current player and each other seat: one card for one
card, executed when both sides' vectors say it helps them and both sides'
private gates accept, best deal first, until nothing clears.

A graph publishes nothing yet: a network seat's vector stays all-zero, so a
served checkpoint never trades — but the table does, and the record it is fed
carries every seat's vector and hands that a trade has moved. `max_trades=0`
in the metadata is the explicit off switch.

## What is never part of this contract

`onnxbot.py`'s job stops at reading these names and shapes. It never imports
or inspects anything else about how a checkpoint was produced, and a
checkpoint's author never needs this repo's source to write one — only this
document, the ONNX spec, and the topology fingerprint of the board they are
targeting.
