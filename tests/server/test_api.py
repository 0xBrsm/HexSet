"""Games, seats, codes and tokens — `hexset.server.api` without a socket.

Everything here calls `Tables.handle` the way `web.py` would, so the routing
and the rules are pinned together; `test_web.py` covers only what the HTTP
transport adds on top. `search2` is named explicitly at every call rather than
left to `Config.default_bots`, which would seat whatever `.onnx` files happen
to be in `models/` and drag onnxruntime into a suite that has no need of it.
